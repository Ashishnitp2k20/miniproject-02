Phonebook Management System
Header file i used here is
#include <bits/stdc++.h> --> it takes all the required header files by itself.
Data Structure:
                1. vector of pairs
                2. string
Operations Performed
                1. Insertion
                2. Deletion
                3. Searching
                4. Listing Phonebook contents
Time complexity
                The time complexit would be O(n) because of one loop for each:
                                                                      1. Insertion
                                                                      2. Deletion
                                                                      3. Searching
                                                                      4. Listing Phonebook contents
Space Complexity
                  The Space Complexity is O(n) because we are storing n number of contacts.
